## Project Introduction ##

Since the project is focused on the development of database, the project will be done in 2 phases to keep the focus on the step-by-step execution and documentation:

**Phase-1: Focus on the development of the database and app for the local desktop environment**

    1. Create a database in the PostgreSQL in the desktop environment
    2. Create required tables and populate tables with required information
    3. Create User Interface and run the app in the local desktop environment by accessing content from the PostgreSQL local server 
    and generating pages based on the database information
    
**Phase-2: Focus on the deployment of the database and app for the online environment**

    1. While all the features of the app will be developed in the first phase, user login features will be developed in the second phase
    2. Upload all the coding files in the GitHub repository
    3. Create a cloud storage like Amazon S3 to store the database information for online access
    4. Create Heroku application using their hobby plan
